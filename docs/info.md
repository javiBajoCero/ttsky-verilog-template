## How it works
This is just an UART + small WS2812b single led driver

Listens to ascii 'MARCO' and once detected, with 10us delay (mega fast) replies with '\n\rPOLO!\n\r' and blips the LED from red to green.

## How to test
The device will need 50Mhz clock. (provided by the RP2 )

Connect ui[0]: "uartRX" and uo[0]: "uartTX" with your favourite UART gizmo, i used my PC and FTDI FT2232HQ USB-UART bridge builtin my ArtyS7 evaluation board.

with default putty serial settings 9600 bauds 
8 data bits 
1 stop bit 
parity NONE 

and type uppercase 'MARCO' trough UART RX pin
you should receive a '\n\rPOLO!\n\r' on UART TX pin

Some extra debugging signals are also exposed :     
-  uo[1]: "baud_tick_rx" //clock for 9600*8 bauds
-  uo[2]: "baud_tick_tx" //clock for 9600 bauds   
-  uo[3]: "trigger_send" //flank signaling the start of uart txing
-  uo[4]: "uartTxbusy"  //stays high as long as uart is Txing
-  uo[5]: "led_data_out"    //connect the single WS2812b led here.

## External hardware

probably a USB to TTL dongle like CP2102,
and a WS2812b led
